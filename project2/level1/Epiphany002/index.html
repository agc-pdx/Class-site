I am my art.
Its imperfections are my own
exposure.
Old work is my biography
and to criticize it unfairly is not loving myself.
Rushing and half-effort becomes personal insult.
I want to give you the best parts of me
who I really believe I am.
If I produce great art it is because I am my greatest fan.
How could you ever believe in me if I didn’t first?
It would be sad not to love your own art.
 
 
 
A guitar is a tool of art
sometimes I think I’d like to have one
but in my hands it could do nothing.
I do have a typewriter
a different kind of paintbrush for a different kind of art
Everyone has an instrument.
