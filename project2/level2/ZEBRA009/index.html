    Swiftly in forests, the <strong>zebra</strong>,
    <br>
    Slowly the <em>Mississippi</em>;  
    <br>
    <strong>Zebras</strong> are by the <em>Mississippi</em>,
    
   
    
 <div>&Not so by, but by.</div>     
    
   Where the palm-tree waves slowly in heat, with many-
    <BR>
        with many-colored, little live things all about, 
        
        <br>
        green, orange, pink, black, purple, red and all,
     <br>
    
    O, do say, the <em><em>Mississippi</em></em> flows slowly.
    <br>
    
    Hell, is not the same moon over <strong>zebras</strong> and the <em>Mississippi</em>?
    <br>
    
    Put <strong>zebras</strong> by the <em><em>Mississippi</em></em>
    <br>
    
    Put ichneumons by the <em><em>Mississippi</em></em>
    <br>
    
    Put the <em>Mississippi</em> anywhere.
    <br>
    
    Put zebras where you like.
    <br>
    
    Put palm-trees in New York state.
    <br>
    
    The moon’s over all.
    <br>
    
    The moon’s not so big.
    <br>
    
    <strong>Zebras</strong> are by the <em>Mississippi</em>.
    <br>
    
    Purple’s by the <em>Mississippi</em>.
    <br> 
    
    Palm-trees are.
    <br>
    
    Anywhere’s anywhere, 
    <br>

    anywhere’s everywhere.
    <br>
    
    Anything’s everywhere.
    <br>
    
    Put <strong>zebras</strong> by the <em>Mississippi</em>; O, do.
    <br>
    
    O, do.
