    <h5>Swiftly in forests, the zebra,
    <br>
    Slowly the Mississippi;  
    <br>
    Zebras are by the Mississippi,

    <h4> &Not so by, but by.
    <br> 
       Where the palm-tree waves slowly in heat, 
    <BR>
        with many-colored, little live things all about,
    </h4>


       <h3>
       
        green, orange, pink, black, purple, red and all,
     <br>
    
    O, do say, the Mississippi flows slowly.
    <br>
    Hell, is not the same moon over zebras and the Mississippi?
       </h3>
    
    <h2>
   
    Put zebras by the Mississippi.
    <br>
    
    Put ichneumons by the Mississippi.
    <br>
    Put the Mississippi anywhere.

    Put zebras where you like.
    <br>
    
    Put palm-trees in New York state.
    <br>

    <h3>

    The moon’s over all.<br>
    
    The moon’s not so big.
    <br>
    
    Zebras are by the Mississippi.
   
    
</h3>
<h4>
    Purple’s by the Mississippi.<br>

    Palm-trees are.

    Anywhere’s anywhere, 
    <br>

<h5>anywhere’s everywhere.
    <br>
    Anything’s everywhere.
    <br>
    
    Put zebras by the Mississippi; O, do. O, do.
