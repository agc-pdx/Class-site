    Swiftly in forests, the zebra,
    <br>
    Slowly the Mississippi;  
    <br>
    Zebras are by the Mississippi,
    <br> 
    &Not so by, but by.
    <br> 
      
    Where the palm-tree waves slowly in heat, with many-
    <BR>
        colored, little live things all about, green, orange, pink,
        <br>
     black, purple, red and all,
     <br>
    
    O, do say, the Mississippi flows slowly.
    <br>
    
    Hell, is not the same moon over zebras and the Mississippi?
    <br>
    
    Put zebras by the Mississippi.
    <br>
    
    Put ichneumons by the Mississippi.
    <br>
    
    Put the Mississippi anywhere.
    <br>
    
    Put zebras where you like.
    <br>
    
    Put palm-trees in New York state.
    <br>
    
    The moon’s over all.
    <br>
    
    The moon’s not so big.
    <br>
    
    Zebras are by the Mississippi.
    <br>
    
    Purple’s by the Mississippi.
    <br> 
    
    Palm-trees are.
    <br>
    
    Anywhere’s anywhere, anywhere’s everywhere.
    <br>
    
    Anything’s everywhere.
    <br>
    
    Put zebras by the Mississippi; O, do.
    <br>
    
    O, do.
